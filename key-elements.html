            <h2>Key Elements of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science dedicated to creating systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Here are some of the key elements of AI:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. It enables systems to improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information and learn complex patterns through training.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
            <p>Natural Language Processing involves the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, making it essential for applications like chatbots and language translation.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Computer Vision</h3>
            <p>Computer Vision is a field of AI that enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data from the world. It is used in applications such as image recognition, autonomous vehicles, and facial recognition.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Robotics</h3>
            <p>Robotics combines AI with physical robots to create systems that can perform tasks in the real world. Robots can be programmed to carry out repetitive tasks, interact with their environment, and adapt to new situations.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Expert Systems</h3>
            <p>Expert Systems are AI programs that mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts. They use a set of rules and knowledge to solve complex problems and provide recommendations based on expert knowledge.</p>
            
            <h2>Upcoming Features and Trends in AI</h2>
            <p>As AI technology continues to advance, several exciting trends and features are emerging:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Explainable AI:</strong> Developing AI systems that can provide clear explanations for their decisions and actions.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Ethics:</strong> Addressing ethical concerns and ensuring responsible AI development and deployment.</li>
                <li><strong>Generative AI:</strong> Creating systems that can generate new content, such as images, text, or music, based on learned patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>AI in Healthcare:</strong> Enhancing diagnostics, personalized medicine, and drug discovery through advanced AI techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>AI and Edge Computing:</strong> Bringing AI processing closer to data sources to improve efficiency and reduce latency.</li>
            </ul>
